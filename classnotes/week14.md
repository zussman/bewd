#Week 14 Notes
##User Stories
See the instagram user story example in the bewd.ninja notes.
Pattern of a User Story:
1. Who?
2. What?
3. Why?

You need to think about the different types of users and their user stories. User stories are used in **agile** software a lot. We will use them to define our functionality and when you get into the software development world you'll see them all the time. You have to use them to plan out the code that you'll write.

You might also create a paper prototype.

"As a user, when I <perform some action> I should <see something happen>."

###Epics, User Stories, Themes, and Scrum Epics
Scrum epics are large user stories. A good example would be "hero journey, like the Odyssey". Epics are still a large user story that aren't entirely fleshed out. An example might be "Odysseus returns home and defeats his enemies". A user story should be more fleshed out: "Odysseus makes a long journey to return from war and reclaim his household".

###Stakeholders
Anyone who has a stake in the software.

##Wireframes
Hand-written ideas that will be used by your stakeholders. The designer will create a more polished version of your wireframe. Should be simple, quick, and easy.

Look up Turbolinks.
