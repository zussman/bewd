#Class Notes Week 2
What we'll get from them:
* In class labs/code alongs
* Homework
* Slides via bewd.ninja
* Student handouts available in Github
* Instructor & TAs

### The Web Development Stack
* The client is the browser, which speaks in HTTP.
* The server holds the backend languages like Ruby.

You can call a legitimate amount of JavaScript "backend".

### Work like a developer
* Use stackoverflow, etc. and other tools. There is a Ruby framework he mentioned that I didn't quite get. Ask him about this!

##Command Lines
Many dev tools are written specifically for the command line. You have to know how to use it to use those tools. Also, when we run our programs, often times it is through the command line. This is where we will be writing and testing our code.

###Modifiers and Permissions
Modifiers that you place on a command are often called "flags". They can also be called "arguments". You can use ls -l to see permissioning for a file. You should be interested. "rw = read/write", "r = read access". You can change around permissions with chmod. This is just basics on file permissioning.

How did he see the permissioning?

*Woah, he moves FAST!*

Make sure you come prepared dude!

###Set up the tree
We downloaded tree from homebrew and began working through setting up a file structure using the command line.

###Remove directories
You can delete a directory by using ``` rm -r bar```

*Do the Bash Basics Exercise!!!*

**Stack exchange** is a great place for information. The other good one is apidock.com. It has really great help on ruby and ruby on rails. That is bill's favorite numeral method on there. Not required for today's homework but you should definitely look it up

#Github! (and git)
##Git Basics
You can use git and github to version your files. Github has a cool feature called "organizations" that allow you to siphon your work between personal work for yourself and business work you make for your company. That's nice to know.

Keep your commit messages to 50 characters or less! In fact, it's good to use the subl command on slack to make it so that when you enter ```git commit``` the Terminal will open Sublime Text and you can enter your commit name and notes there instead of in the Terminal. Bill says this is best practice. It's pretty cool.

A **shaw** is a cryptographic string that is a unique identifier. Git uses them to identify each commit. That's a really important string because it saves your information uniquely.

##Tab Completion
Tab completion is really cool. Start typing a word, and hit tab to complete it. It's pretty cool.

##Github
Git push usually requires another term to actually get pushed to but because Github is so ubiquitous you can just type ```git push``` rather than ```git push heroku```

##Homework
For homework: Fork, update, and submit a pull request for our homework/dev_workflow branch.
