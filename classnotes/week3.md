#Week 3 Class Notes
##Collections and Loops
Today we'll do iterations and loops, arrays and hashes. Hashes are called dictionaries or maps in other languages.

###.times method
The **times** method iterates based on a number object. You can go to the source code for help! This is called a **prop**.

Use Rubinius as a guide for looking up methods you don't understand.

###Ruby style guide stuff:
* One line stuff should use {} brackets.
* Multi line stuff should use **do** and **end**.
* Always use two spaces, *not* tabs.

There are some less-common iterators, which are in the slides.
