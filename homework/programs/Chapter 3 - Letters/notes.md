#Chapter 3 - Letters
**Strings** are groups of letters in a program. Think of beads with letters on them being strung together. Here are some examples of strings:

```
'Hello.'
'Ruby rocks.'
'Nobody deserves a mime, Buffy.'
'Snoopy says @#$! when he stubs his toe.'
'       '
''
```
Strings can have punctuation, digits, symbols, and spaces in them...more than just letters. The last string doesn't have anything in it at all. We call that an **emptry string**.

##3.1 String Arithmetic
You can do arithmetic with strings just like with numbers! Okay, so maybe not exactly like with numbers, but kind of like with numbers!

You can use the plus sign '+' to concatenate two strings together:

```
puts 'I like ' + 'apple pie.'
will print out 'I like apple pie.'
```
