# The Command Line Crash Course
## Introduction: Shut Up and Shell
You have to learn how to use the command line if you are going to be a programmer. You just have to.

So do it. Type without fear. Make your computer an extension of yourself.

## How to use this book
* Start at the beginning and do each exercise exactly as you are told.
* Use a small pad of paper and a pen.
* When you read something that doesn't make sense or that you don't understand, write it down! Leave space so that you can go back and answer.
* After you finish an exercise, go back through your notebook and review the questions you have. Try to answer them by researching online or reaching out to the instructors during office hours.

## Memorize This
* You have to memorize command line stuff, or else it really isn't so valuable.
* Make index cards.
* Drill index cards 15-30 minutes each day.
* Before you go to bed, drill the cards you got wrong for about 5 minutes, then go to sleep.

**Do NOT take command line advice from a random person on the Internet. Some hackers post misleading or harmful commands. Be wary.**
